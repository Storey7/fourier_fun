# Fourier Series Visualization
A quick project playing around with the openFrameWorks C++ toolkit. 
Can use GUI to increase the number of iterations or the type of wave.  

## Images
![square](./images/square.png)
![sawtooth](./images/sawtooth.png)

## To Do 
- Add more wave types.
- Add Gui controls for speed and radius. 
- Add color control / more tracelines.
